## 1. Introduction

This project aims to:
- Analyze financial news articles using NLP techniques.
- Extract stock ticker information from the news.
- Perform sentiment analysis and time series forecasting to predict stock movements.
- Understand the correlation between news sentiment and stock performance.

---

## 2. Project Structure

The project consists of the following key sections:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Data inspection, cleaning, and visualization.
2. **Stock Ticker Extraction:** Identification and mapping of stock tickers using NLP.
3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Polarity analysis of news articles to measure sentiment.
4. **Forecasting Models:** Machine learning models to predict stock price movements.
5. **Correlation Analysis:** Quantifying the impact of news sentiment on stock performance.

## 3. Requirements

To replicate this analysis, you will need the following:
- Python (3.7+)
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - nltk
  - WordCloud
  - sklearn
  - keras/tensorflow (if using deep learning models)

## 4.  Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Data Loading:** Load the financial news data and stock price data into appropriate data structures (e.g., Pandas DataFrames).
2. **Data Cleaning:** 
    - Handle missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).
    - Remove duplicates and irrelevant data.
    - Clean the text data by removing special characters, HTML tags, and irrelevant symbols.
3. **Text Preprocessing:** 
    - Convert text to lowercase.
    - Tokenize the text into individual words.
    - Remove stop words (common words like "the," "a," "is").
    - Perform stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.
4. **Feature Engineering:**
    - Create new features from the stock price data (e.g., moving averages, price differences).
    - Calculate technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD).

### Sentiment Analysis

1. **Sentiment Model Training:** 
    - Train a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, LSTM) to classify news articles as positive, negative, or neutral based on their sentiment.
    - Utilize techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) for text representation.
2. **Sentiment Prediction:** 
    - Apply the trained sentiment model to the news articles in the dataset to predict their sentiment scores.

### Feature Engineering

1. **Combine Features:** Combine the predicted sentiment scores with the stock price features and other relevant features (e.g., trading volume, market indices).

### Model Training and Evaluation

1. **Split Data:** Split the data into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Selection:** Choose an appropriate machine learning model for stock price prediction (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM).
3. **Model Training:** Train the chosen model on the training data.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared).


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)



## Results

- Present the results of the sentiment analysis model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Present the results of the stock price prediction model (e.g., performance metrics on the test set).
- Discuss the findings and insights gained from the analysis.

## Introduction

This project explores the hypothesis that financial news sentiment significantly influences stock price movements. By analyzing the sentiment expressed in news articles related to a particular stock, we aim to develop predictive models that can forecast future price trends. This can provide valuable insights for investors and traders.

## Data

The project utilizes a dataset containing:

- **Financial News Articles:** A collection of news articles related to various companies and market events.
- **Stock Prices:** Historical stock price data (e.g., open, high, low, close, volume) for the corresponding companies.

**Data Source:** [Link to Kaggle dataset]

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Data Loading:** Load the financial news data and stock price data into appropriate data structures (e.g., Pandas DataFrames).
2. **Data Cleaning:** 
    - Handle missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).
    - Remove duplicates and irrelevant data.
    - Clean the text data by removing special characters, HTML tags, and irrelevant symbols.
3. **Text Preprocessing:** 
    - Convert text to lowercase.
    - Tokenize the text into individual words.
    - Remove stop words (common words like "the," "a," "is").
    - Perform stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.
4. **Feature Engineering:**
    - Create new features from the stock price data (e.g., moving averages, price differences).
    - Calculate technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD).

### Sentiment Analysis

1. **Sentiment Model Training:** 
    - Train a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, LSTM) to classify news articles as positive, negative, or neutral based on their sentiment.
    - Utilize techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) for text representation.
2. **Sentiment Prediction:** 
    - Apply the trained sentiment model to the news articles in the dataset to predict their sentiment scores.

### Feature Engineering

1. **Combine Features:** Combine the predicted sentiment scores with the stock price features and other relevant features (e.g., trading volume, market indices).

### Model Training and Evaluation

1. **Split Data:** Split the data into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Selection:** Choose an appropriate machine learning model for stock price prediction (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM).
3. **Model Training:** Train the chosen model on the training data.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared).

## Results

- Present the results of the sentiment analysis model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Present the results of the stock price prediction model (e.g., performance metrics on the test set).
- Discuss the findings and insights gained from the analysis.

## Conclusion

Summarize the key findings and conclusions of the project. Discuss the limitations of the current approach and potential areas for improvement.

## Future Work

- Explore advanced deep learning models for sentiment analysis and stock price prediction (e.g., Transformers, Convolutional Neural Networks).
- Incorporate external factors such as economic indicators, social media trends, and news from multiple sources.
- Develop a real-time system for continuous news monitoring and stock price prediction.
